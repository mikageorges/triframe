triframe/layer1.py

Layer 1 (model-functional): what a trained model's own internal
mechanisms directly expose about token reliance, via two signals.

  aggregate_attention() — per-token attention weight, averaged over
    samples (and folds, if you pass more than one).

  run_ablation() — classification accuracy drop when a token's
    contribution is removed. Two variants:
      "feature_zero" : zero the token's raw input features before the
                        forward pass (removes all content).
      "token_zero"   : zero only the token's row in the token tensor
                        (isolates the fusion/attention pathway, leaving
                        whatever the token contributed upstream intact).

Both functions take a ModelAdapter and a TokenRegistry and return a
Layer1Result: raw per-sample (or per-fold) values, plus a fold-aggregated
mean/std if you passed more than one fold's worth of data.

    batches : one item per fold (or a single-item list for no fold
              structure). Each item is whatever adapter.run_forward()
              expects.
    labels  : one item per entry in `batches`, holding whatever ground

              through to score_fn unmodified. Its structure (class
              labels, regression targets, reference sequences, ...) is
              entirely up to you.
    zero_fn : your function implementing the actual "zero out this token"
              operation for `mode`. Called as
              zero_fn(batch, [token_name], registry) -> modified_batch.
              What "zeroing" means (raw feature values vs. the token
              tensor row) is entirely up to you — mode is passed through
              for your own bookkeeping/branching if one zero_fn handles
              both modes, but triframe does not interpret it.
    mode    : "feature_zero" or "token_zero" — label only, for your own
              zero_fn and for reading raw/aggregated results back later.
              Not enforced or interpreted by triframe itself.
    score_fn : score_fn(output_value, labels) -> float, HIGHER = BETTER,
              on whatever scale is meaningful for your task (accuracy,
              negative MSE, log-likelihood, a task-specific metric —
              triframe only ever takes differences of this value, so any
              scale works as long as higher means better). Defaults to
              an identity/no-op scorer that assumes output_value is
              already a scalar-per-sample score and just averages it —
              this will be WRONG for classification logits; for a ready
              classification accuracy scorer, import
              triframe.presets.classification_accuracy_fn and pass it
              explicitly.
